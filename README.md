## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install packages**
    <br/>
    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.
    ```shell
    cd internorm/
    yarn
    ```
    <br/><br/>
2.  **Create config file.**
    <br/>
    Create .env.development for develop mode or .env.production for production mode.
    <br/><br/>
    Add into a config file:
    ```shell
    WPGRAPHQL_URL='http://internorm.local/graphql'
    COOKIES_KEY='cookies_key'
    ```
    <br/><br/>
3.  **Start developing.**
    <br/>
    Run:
    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```
    <br/><br/>
4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**
    <br/>
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    <br/>
    You'll also see a second link: \_`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
